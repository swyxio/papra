# swyx Drive

This maintained Papra fork powers the authorized team-drive deployment at https://drive.swyx.io for swyx, AI Engineer, Latent Space and Smol. Based on stable `@papra/app@26.6.2`. Modified source is public under AGPL-3.0-or-later; upstream notices are retained. See [operations](infra/cloudflare/README.md) and [executed verification](infra/cloudflare/VERIFICATION.md) for architecture, release, backup/recovery and material limitations.

Colleagues can create their account at [Drive signup](https://drive.swyx.io/register) using a verified `@ai.engineer`, `@latent.space` or `@smol.ai` Google account. No invitation is needed: first sign-in creates a private Personal space and adds ordinary member access to the matching team. Choose the team in the space menu and upload into its Home folder for team files. Restricted folders require their own permission.

## Introduction

**Papra** is a minimalistic document management and archiving platform. It is designed to be simple to use and accessible to everyone. Papra is a platform for long-term document storage and management, like a digital archive for your documents.

Forget about that receipt of that gift you bought for your friend last year, or that warranty for your new phone. With Papra, you can easily store, forget, and retrieve your documents whenever you need them.

A live demo of the platform is available at [demo.papra.app](https://demo.papra.app) (no backend, client-side local storage only).

## Support

Papra is a free and open-source project, but it is not free to run and develop. If you want to support the project, you can become a sponsor on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/corentinth) or [Buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/cthmsst).
If you are a company, you can also [contact me](https://papra.app/contact) to discuss a sponsorship.

## Self-hosting

Papra is dedicated to providing a simple yet highly configurable self-hosting experience.

For a quick start, simply run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name papra -p 1221:1221 -e AUTH_SECRET=a-dummy-secret-for-testing-purposes-only ghcr.io/papra-hq/papra:latest
```

> The `AUTH_SECRET` above is fine for kicking the tires, but for any real instance you should generate your own with `openssl rand -hex 48` (or similar).

Please refer to the [self-hosting documentation](https://docs.papra.app/self-hosting/using-docker) for more information and configuration options.
